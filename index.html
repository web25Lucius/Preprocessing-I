            My first performance was when I was three. 
          Ask me about my Chuck Norris movie.   
          
          I'm a performer with strong communication skills.  
          In 2017 I joined the Detroit UnTheatre's NeoFuturism troop as a resident company member.  NeoFuturism is a break from traditional theatre. 
          Our never ending show is a collection of new plays called "Too Much Light Makes the Baby Go Blind".  We write new shows every week for our attempt at 30 plays in 60 minutes. 
          The audience interacts with us, though the show is not improvised.  
          Too Much Light is written, rehearsed, and produced in one week by a talented company of trained performers in different spaces all over the world. Patrons who come to visit our shows have high expectations that we uphold the legacy.  The show began in 1988 and are still opening companies around the globe.  
          Acting, directing, and writing under pressure has taught me a lot about how to read a room and the importance of delivering consistent excellence.  You know what they say, you're only as good as your last show.  
          This is a clip from a short play I wrote for the Detroit UnTheatre.
