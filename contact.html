          Theatre and Arts inclusive education has taught me how to communicate with all ages, abilities and personalities.

          Every problem is an opportunity to learn a new solution.  Since 2006 I've been strategizing how to reach discouraged students.  My specialty was students who had given up. Persistence is what changed tests scores.

          Performing is a bit like working in the postal service.  We work rain, shine, sleet or snow.  The difference is, we don't get holidays off.  And almost every weekend and evening you are booked.  
          I'm used to long hours, and I'm consistent.

          I taught everyBody.  Which means all ages and abilities.  I've taught and consulted with schools and organizations on how to grow Access.  I'm excited to extend this focus into tech.
